This is a FastHTML app. You can read about the best practices from these two resources:

- https://www.fastht.ml/docs/ref/concise_guide.html.md
- https://www.fastht.ml/docs/ref/best_practice.md

Always code in the style of FastHTML and HTMX. Use minimal JS, and only when necessary, and HTMX can't be used instead.
